This is a program authored by KyleJohnstonNet and I for the University of Houston faculty. It extracts needed information from a series of provided excel documents, sorting them accordingly and applying a series of calculations. 

The API used is called "EPPLUS" and can be found at http://epplus.codeplex.com/. All excel handling was done through this API.
